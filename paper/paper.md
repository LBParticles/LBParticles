# Summary

`LBParticles` is a Python Package that models particle orbits in central potentials on a galaxy scale. The model conserves quantities (Specific) where numerical integrations of the equations of motion would not due to numerical inaccuracies. It also has a faster computation speed than integration methods due to valid approximations of analyitical equations. This methodology builds upon Lynden-Bell's previous work '@LyndenBound2015:2015'.
